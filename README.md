## Python
Python is an object-oriented lauguage

## Output
Output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

To output we use 'print'()

## Comments
Comments are notes that the compiler skips over

to use comments, we use '# COMMENT' for single-line

We use  '''COMMENT''' for block comments

## Data Types
We will be working with 5 main data types

1. Integer (int) - whole numbers
2. Character (char) - a singla letter/symbol/number
3. Sting (str) - collection of characters
4. Floating point (float) - decimal numbers
5. Boolean (bool) - True/False

## Variables
Variables are containers that hold a value

### Rules for Variable name
1. Always start with a letter
   "!name = "Celine" ` --> NOT ALLOWED
2. Can only contain nubers, letters, and underscores( _ ) `my name = Celine ` --> NOT ALLOWED
3. If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to separate words
    `myFirstname` or `my_first_name`

## Concatenation
`+` Adding strings together, appending (add to end)

`"Hello" + "World" = "Hello World"

## Type Cast
Forcing a data type on a value

### To force am integer into a string
`str(variableName)`

### To force a string into an integer
`int(variableName)`
